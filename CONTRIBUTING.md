# Contributing

Developers wishing to contribute to ruby-lint are required to follow a specific
set of requirements. These requirements are described in the following article:
<http://yorickpeterse.com/articles/contributing-to-my-code/>.

These requirements are put in place to ensure a consistent code base, a
streamlined development process and clear rules about what is and is not
accepted. Although these requirements may seem a little bit daunting at first
the whole process of making sure everything is set up correctly should take no
more than a few minutes. In case you make a mistake or simply aren't sure about
something I'll do my best to help you out.

A copy of the DCO mentioned in the above article can be found in the file
`doc/DCO.md`. A copy of the license can be found in the file `LICENSE`.
