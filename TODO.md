# TODO

This document is meant to keep track of things that have to be done before
Rlint becomes even remotely useful.

## Parser

* Regular expressions
* case statements
* single line statements (`foo rescue bar`, `foo = 10 if bar`, etc)
* other syntax elements as I bump into them

## Analyzing

* An event loop that makes it easy to efficiently iterate over the AST
  generated by the parser. There should also be an efficient way to analyze the
  entire source code/AST at once without being limited to the AST nodes for the
  current iteration.
